# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background of the Study

In the contemporary landscape of higher education, access to quality education remains a significant challenge for many students due to financial constraints. At the University of Cebu Lapu Lapu and Mandaue (UCLM), the scholarship office personnel face daily challenges in managing various scholarship programs, evaluating grades, and creating endorsements for scholars. While these scholarship programs are essential for supporting deserving students, the current manual processes create operational inefficiencies that affect both the administration and the students' experience. The ScholarPath web application emerges as a tailored solution for UCLM's scholarship management needs, offering a comprehensive platform for efficient scholarship administration and grade evaluation.

The current manual processes in UCLM's scholarship administration often result in delayed applications, time-consuming grade evaluations, and complex endorsement procedures. The scholarship office staff must manually review applications, verify eligibility criteria, evaluate academic performance, and create endorsement documents - tasks that require significant time and effort. Additionally, students face challenges in identifying scholarships that match their qualifications among UCLM's various scholarship programs. This technological gap affects both administrators and students, potentially impacting the effectiveness of the university's scholarship programs and their intended benefits.

## 1.2 Statement of the Problem

The study aims to address the following key problems in scholarship management:

1. How can the scholarship application and evaluation process be streamlined to improve efficiency and accuracy?
2. What system can be implemented to effectively monitor scholars' academic performance and ensure compliance with scholarship requirements?
3. How can the communication between scholarship administrators and scholars be enhanced to provide better support and guidance?
4. What measures can be taken to ensure transparent and fair evaluation of scholarship applications?

## 1.3 Project Objectives

### General Objective
To develop and implement a web-based scholarship management system that streamlines the application process, enhances monitoring capabilities, and improves the overall administration of scholarship programs.

### Specific Objectives

1. To create a centralized platform for managing scholarship applications and evaluations
2. To implement an automated grade evaluation system for monitoring scholars' academic performance
3. To establish a systematic approach for tracking scholarship status and requirements
4. To provide real-time updates and notifications for both administrators and scholars
5. To maintain accurate records of scholarship disbursements and academic progress

## 1.4 Scope and Limitations

### Scope

The ScholarPath web application encompasses the following features:

1. User Management
   - Student and UCLM administrator account management
   - Profile management for scholars
   - Role-based access control for scholarship office personnel

2. Scholarship Management
   - Streamlined application submission and processing
   - Support for UCLM-specific scholarship types
   - Automated scholarship matching based on UCLM criteria
   - Document upload and verification
   - Application status tracking

3. Grade Evaluation System
   - Automated grade processing and evaluation for UCLM standards
   - GPA calculation and monitoring
   - Scholarship status assessment based on UCLM academic requirements
   - Grade requirement compliance checking
   - Automated endorsement generation

4. Reporting and Analytics
   - Comprehensive scholarship distribution reports
   - Academic performance tracking
   - Statistical analysis of UCLM scholarship programs
   - Endorsement tracking and management

### Limitations

1. The system is limited to managing academic-based scholarships and does not handle financial aid programs
2. Grade evaluation is dependent on the accuracy of uploaded grade data
3. The system requires manual upload of grades and does not integrate directly with external grading systems
4. Document verification is limited to digital format submissions
5. The system does not handle financial disbursement processes
